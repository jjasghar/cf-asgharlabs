This is a demo repo for using Cloud Foundry on the IBM Cloud.

I have written a couple scripts in [./scripts](scripts/) to
make this easy to run for demos.

1) `01_output_code.sh` shows off the code for the sinatra app.

2) `02_change_the_code.sh` changes the code for the sinatra app.

3) `03_push_the_code.sh` pushes the code for the sinatra app.

4) `99_reset.sh` resets everything to the start.

BONUS: `booth_loop.sh` will just run it over and over for a screen.
